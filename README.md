Breakdown of Tasks:
--------------------

**Patrick**

Step 1: Data Preparation and Analysis

Load and Explore the Datasets:

Use Pandas in Python to load the Marvel vs DC and comic characters datasets.

Explore the data, understand the columns, and identify key features for analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing or inconsistent data in the datasets.

Merge and preprocess the datasets to prepare them for analysis.

Data Analysis:

Use Python for data analysis, exploring correlations, and extracting insights from the combined dataset.

Step 2: Store Data in MongoDB

Set Up MongoDB:

Install MongoDB and set up a database and collection to store the combined and preprocessed data.

Insert Data:

Use Python to insert the cleaned and preprocessed data into MongoDB for easy access and retrieval.

Step 3: Build Backend with Python and Flask

Set Up a Flask Application:

Create a Flask application to serve as the backend for your web application.

Define API Endpoints:

Define endpoints to interact with the MongoDB database, allowing querying of the comic characters and movies data.

**Libnis**

Step 4: Build Frontend with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript

Design the Web Interface:

Create HTML templates for search forms and result displays using CSS for styling.

Implement JavaScript:

Use JavaScript to handle user interactions, make API calls to the Flask backend, and update the UI with the results.

Step 5: Integrate Backend and Frontend

Connect Backend and Frontend:

Ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend by making HTTP requests to the defined API endpoints.

Display Results:

Update the UI to display search results and correlations based on user inputs.

**Research Questions:** 
---------------------

1. How does a characters' identity influence their alignment(good, bad, neutral)?

2.   How does the number of good vs bad characters changes over x period of years in both DC and Marvel?

3.   How does the number of appearances in  DC/Marvel comics compare to the films released?

4.   Film Release : Is there a particular MPA rating that peforms better over another?
